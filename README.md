# Hello bun

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.42.
[Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

What if I do not have bun installed.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

and look at [localhost](http://localhost)
